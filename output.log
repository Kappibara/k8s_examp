exported. You have 3 options:

1. Unset the ZSH variable when calling the installer:
   `ZSH= sh install.sh`
2. Install Oh My Zsh to a directory that doesn't exist yet:
   `ZSH=path/to/new/ohmyzsh/folder sh install.sh`
3. (Caution) If the folder doesn't contain important information,
   you can just remove it with `rm -r /home/user/.oh-my-zsh`
